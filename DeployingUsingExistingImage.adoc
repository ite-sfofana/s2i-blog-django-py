# Deploying from an image

An image is automatically built from the openshiftkatacode repository when code changes are made using the Docker Hub automated build mechanism.

To deploy the sample application from the command line, you can run:

```
oc new-app openshiftkatacoda/blog-django-py --name blog-from-image
oc expose svc/blog-from-image
```

Get the external url and go to a browser to see the application

````
oc get route/blog-from-image
