# Deploying from an image

An image is automatically built from this repository when code changes are made using the Docker Hub automated build mechanism.

To deploy the sample application from the command line, you can run:

```
oc new-app ite-sfofana/s2i-blog-django-py --name blog-from-image
oc expose svc/blog-from-image
```
