# Deploying using the docker strategy

To build and deploy the sample application from the command line, you can run:

```
oc new-app https://github.com/ite-sfofana/s2i-blog-django-py --name blog-from-docker
oc expose svc/blog-from-docker
```

This relies on ``oc new-app`` doing auto detection and finding that a ``Dockerfile`` exists. If you want to be specific, you can use the ``--strategy=docker`` option to be sure.
