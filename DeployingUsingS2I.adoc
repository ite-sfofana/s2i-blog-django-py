= Deploying an app using source to image

In this lab we will deploy an app directly from source code without using a Dockerfile 

```
oc login -u developer -p developer
oc new-project s2i-lab
```
== Deploy the app with the builder image
....
oc new-app python:latest~https://github.com/ite-sfofana/s2i-blog-django-py
....

== To monitor the log output from the build as it is running, run the command:

....
oc logs bc/s2i-blog-django-py --follow
....

To see the status of the deployed applications run the command

....
oc status
....

Now if everything is ok, we can expose our service to external use

....
oc expose svc/s2i-blog-django-py
....

To see the url of the application run the following command:
...
oc get route/s2i-blog-django-py
...

Now we can open the url in a browser to see the app.
